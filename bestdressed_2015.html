			<h4><strong>Best Dressed NLP Researchers (2015)</strong></h4>

			<h5 id="news">Editor's (my) Notes</h5>
			
			Some highlights from the past year:
			<br>
			<ul>
			    
			    <li>I heard one last year's winner told his/her colleagues to stay away from me if they are not wearing nice clothes.</li>
			    <li>Another last year's winner told me that this list directs a big chunk of traffic to his homepage. </li>
				 
			</ul>
			
			
			Another thought of the year: 
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li>Only a small fraction of women's clothes sold in the stores are great for CS academia, while most men's clothes are acceptable. I didn't realize this until this year, so maybe many people didn't think about this either. In the hotel elevator at EMNLP this year, I overheard a male student expressing his disapproval over a dress his group mate was wearing. Whether you are a man or a woman, I think this article <a href="https://medium.com/@sailorhg/coding-like-a-girl-595b90791cce#.xwvddva6h">"Coding Like a Girl"</a> will worth a read.</li>
			</ul>
			Last year's list is <a href="bestdressed.html">here</a>. If you want to nominate someone, please email me at <font color=blue><u>xwe@cis.upenn.edu</u></font>.

			<h5>Top 10 (in alphabetical order)</h5>

			<ul>
			    <li><b><a href="http://www.dirkhovy.com/">Dirk Hovy</a></b> earned it this year by his three piece suit. Normally it would have been toooo overdressed, but somehow, probably his full package (hair + personality + whatever) just makes you (at least me) feel right about it. </li> 
				<li><b><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/">Jacob Eisenstein</a></b> THE hipster of NLP.</li> 
			     
			    <li><b><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/">Lillian Lee</a></b> You may see for yourself -- here's a <a href="http://techtalks.tv/talks/invited-talk-big-data-pragmatics-or-putting-the-acl-in-computational-social-science-or-if-you-think-these-title-alternatives-cou/61556/">video</a> of her giving keynote at NAACL.</li> 
			    <li><b><a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz">Luke Zettlemoyer</a></b> for his man bun. I also like <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/">Noah Smith</a>'s suggestion of <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/09/03/a-tiny-fedora-for-your-manbun.html">a tiny fedora</a>.</li>
			    <li><b><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/">Marine Carpuat</a></b> master of blazer.</li> 
			    <li><b><a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~my89/">Mark Yatskar</a></b> not only pulled off a man bun look, but then a shaved head!</li> 
			    <li><b><a href="http://marliesvanderwees.nl/">Marlies van der Wees</a></b>  the youngest on the list. I noticed her work/talk first at ACL then floral pants at EMNLP.</li>
			    <li><b><a href="http://cs.jhu.edu/~post/">Matt Post</a></b> I guess I declared Jacob to be the hipster too fast. This is THE other one.</li> 
			    <li><b><a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/">Yejin Choi</a></b> when I was unsure about what to wear, I referred to her as my inspiration. </li> 
				 <li><b><a href="">[Empty Slot]</a></b> ... I haven't been able to make 10 for the list of most humorous NLP researchers yet, either. I so far have <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/">Ray Mooney</a> for that, also <a href="http://www.denero.org/">John DeNero</a>, <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~knight/">Kevin Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/">Lillian Lee</a> and <a href="http://yoavartzi.com/">Yoav Artzi</a>.</li> 
			</ul>
			
		
			<h5>Watch List</h5>

			<ul>
			    <li><b><a href="http://cst.dk/anders/">Anders SÃ¸gaard</a></b> subtle almost a bit mysterious </li> 		
			    <li><b><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/">Chris Callison-Burch</a></b> Half of me thinks it is unfair to put him on the list, since I work with him; half of me thinks it is also unfair to not put him on the list. Readers, you make your own judgement.</li>	
			    <li><b><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/">Kathy McKeown</a></b> master of dress.</li>
				<li><b><a href="http://www.isi.edu/~knight/">Kevin Knight</a></b> has a good and interesting taste (saw him in a culture icon T-shirt at NAACL), and seems to like to go freestyle for some other days. </li>  
			    <li><b><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yww/">William Yang Wang</a></b> I think I paid more attention to what we were talking about than his clothes. They're usually good --- keep watching. </li>
			    

				<li><b><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez/">Adam Lopez</a></b> (same as above) </li> 
				<li><b><a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/amittai/index.html">Amittai Axelrod</a></b> (same as above) </li>	
				<li><b><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/">Claire Cardie</a></b> (same as above) </li>			 				 
				<li><b> <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a> </b> (same as above) </li>
				<li><b><a href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dekai/">Dekai Wu</a></b> (same as above) </li>
				<li><b><a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~jonatha6/">Jonathan Berant</a></b> (same as above) </li>
				<li><b><a href="http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/">Pascale Fung</a></b> (same as above) </li>
