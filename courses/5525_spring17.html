      <h4>Participation (5%)</h4>
      You will receive credit for asking and answering questions related to the homework on Piazza and engaging in-class discussion.      
      
      <h4>Homework (55%)</h4>

      The homework will include one written assignment, three programming assignments and one market study on a company that uses speech or language techniques. Students should work independently on homework assignments (except that market research can be done by up to two students). Everyone can have three free late days without penalty for the whole semester. After you have used your free late days, you will lose 20% per day that your assignment is submitted late. Please carefully check your submitted homework - if wrong files are submitted for a homework, you may lose all the credits of that homework. 
      

      <h4>Midterm (20%)</h4>
      There will be an in-class midterm before spring break.
      
      <h4>Final Projects (20%)</h4>
      The final project is an open-ended assignment, with the goal of gaining experience applying the techniques presented in class to real-world datasets.  
      Students should work in groups of 3-4. The final project report should be 2-4 pages. The report should describe the problem you are solving, what data is being used, the proposed technique you are applying in addition to
      what baseline is used to compare against. Each group will give a project presentation in the last class on April 21st.

      Any assignment or exam that you hand in must be your own work (with the exception of group projects). Talking with others to better understand the material is strongly encouraged.
      However, copying a solution or letting someone copy your solution is cheating. Code you hand in must be written by you, with the exception of any code provided
      as part of the assignment. <a href="http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/cs230/weeks/w01/moss-in-practice.pdf">MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity)</a> will be used routinely to detect plagiarism on programming assignments.
      Any collaboration during an exam is considered cheating.  Any student who
      is caught cheating will be reported to the Committee on Academic Misconduct and will receive a grade F.  Do not take a chance - if you are having trouble understanding the material, please take advantage of office hours and know that we will be happy to help.

  <div class="panel-body">
    The final project is an open-ended assignment, with the goal of gaining experience applying the techniques presented in class to real-world datasets. Students should work in groups of 3-4. please <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/150GTQ_sd5PgXPiGMoVA8ZdoDTSvmDfOlTIrHOB8DJJU/edit?usp=sharing'>sign up</a> for a group and a project. Each group will <b>submit a report together with data/code, and give a <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VCMxdAqMHel0QthfmsEmACELFbp40ai9BywiYKDb_rI/edit?usp=sharing
'>5-minute project presentation</a> (and/or demo)</b> in the last class on April 21st. It is acceptable to do the same work for this project and another classâ€™s project, however, you must make this clear and write down the exact portion of the project that is being counted for CSE 5525. 
    <br><br>
    For inspiration, here are some <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/">example NLP course projects</a> done by students. There are also many NLP shared tasks with existing datasets and sometimes baseline systems at <a href="http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/index.php?id=tasks">SemEval</a> and <a htef="http://noisy-text.github.io/2017/">WNUT</a> (also check previous years). If you want to get some Twitter data to work with, you can follow the <a href="http://socialmedia-class.org/twittertutorial.html">Twitter API tutorial</a> written by the instructor. At minimal, you could learn and implement the <a href="http://mt-class.org/penn/hw1.html">word alignment</a> or <a href="http://mt-class.org/penn/hw2.html">decoding</a> components in the statistical machine translation system (both are well-structured homework assignments in Machine Translation course).

    <br>
    Report (2-4 pages, not including references):
    <list>
      <li>Title and Author(s)
      <li>Goal: What are you trying to do? Give an example of inputs/outputs or user interaction. How might it be helpful to people?</li>
      <li>Method: How are you trying to solve the problem? What are existing approaches to the problem?</li>
      <li>Experiments: What data do you use? What metric(s) do you use to measure success? What baseline method do you compare against? How well do your methods perform compared with the baseline, and why?</li> 
      <li>Conclusions: What did you learn from your experiments? Suggest future ideas. </li>
      <li>Replicability: Submit (or include links to) all the code that you wrote and all the data that you used.</li>
      <li>Related Work and Reference: This is absolutely necessary. You may use any existing code, libraries, etc. and consult any papers, books, online references, etc. for your project. However, you must cite your sources in your writeup and clearly indicate which parts of the project are your contribution and which parts were implemented by others.</li>
      </list>
    <br>
The rubric for projects is as follows:
    <list>
      <li>An A (90%) project shows evidence of a working implementation; the writeup comprehensively analyzes the system's strengths and weaknesses as well as answering all questions in the assignment; some optional or novel feature has been included, or there is interesting speculation about extensions to the basic algorithm.</li>
<li>A B (80%) project shows evidence of a working implementation. The writeup is adequate, but lacks a full analysis, and there are no suggestions for extensions or novel features.</li>
<li>A C (70%) project shows evidence of a mostly-working implementation, with some attempt to explain what went wrong and why.</li>
<li>A D (60%) project does not work at all, or shows a misunderstanding of basic concepts.</li>
<li>An E (<60%) project is not turned in on time.</li>

    This homework can be done by up to two students.
    <br>
    Step 1: watch some example presentations of company profiling:
    <list>
      <li><a href='https://vimeo.com/106347045'>Example Presentation 1</a> (Icelandâ€™s Crowdsourced Constitution by Abhishek GAdiraju)</li>
      <li><a href='https://vimeo.com/106529777'>Example Presentation 2</a> (Silk Road by Shreshth Khilani)</li>
      <li><a href='https://vimeo.com/106435795'>Example Presentation 3</a> (Kiva: Loans That Change Lives by Morgan Snyder and Tiffany Lu)</li> 
      </list>
    Step 2: please <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/150GTQ_sd5PgXPiGMoVA8ZdoDTSvmDfOlTIrHOB8DJJU/edit?usp=sharing'>sign up</a> for a company and a date for in-class presentation (play your recorded video presentation and answer questions). Please do not pick a company that another student has already signed up for.
    <br>
    Step 3: create a 5-minute video presentation about the company. To turn in your video, please upload it to Vimeo following the <a href='Vimeo_instructions.png'>instructions</a>, then submit the link to your video in <a href='https://carmen.osu.edu/'>Carmen</a>. 
    <br>
    Step 4: if you would like to give other students feedbacks, you may use the peer grading function in Carmen following the <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gaA0KRKKL3gbxFgUbyRfjzV8kRuKOkM4oXJuAekO8vo/edit?usp=sharing'>instructions</a>.

      <li>What are specific areas or applications of speech/NLP the company is interested in?
      <li>What products of the company use speech or NLP technologies?
      <li>What the main users of their speech or NLP technologies?
      <li>Does the company hold any patent using speech or NLP technologies?
      <li>Does the company publish any papers on speech or NLP technologies?
      <li>Is the company recently hiring in NLP? interns? phd?
