			<h4 id="news">PhD positions in natural language processing and machine learning</h4>
			
			Applicants are invited to apply for PhD positions to work on natural language processing and machine learning at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University. Successful applicants are expected to have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Science, Linguistics, or other Science/Engineering majors with programming and research experience.  Interested students should submit their application materials through the following website: <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/prospective-students/cse-graduate-admissions">https://cse.osu.edu/prospective-students/cse-graduate-admissions</a><br><br>
			
			The <a href="https://u.osu.edu/cllt/people/">Computational Linguistics and Language Technology </a> research group at Ohio State currently have eight faculty members in Computer Science & Engineering and Linguistics and a few dozen of PhD students. My main interest is in natural language processing and machine learning. You may learn more about my research on my <a href="./index.html">homepage</a> and through my <a href="./index.html#publications">publications</a>. My research lab aims to support students to become productive researchers and publish high-quality research at top CS/AI conferences and journals (i.e. ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, TACL, and COLING).   
			
			
			<br><br>
			
			Applicants are welcome to send me emails (<a href="mailto:weixu@cse.ohio-state.edu">weixu@cse.ohio-state.edu</a>) for inquiries; please attach a
resume. <br>

		

I also answer some frequent questions below:
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Will you be accepting new students for the year 201X?</h6>
			A: Yes, I take new PhD students every year. Here is a <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/prospective-students/cse-graduate-admissions">link</a> describing how to apply. We usually start making offers in March every year. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Are the PhD positions funded?</h6>
			A: Yes, PhD students are fully funded (including tuition, fees, and a monthly stipend around $1,800). I have research funding and can also support applicants through department/university fellowship and TA-ship. As rent is about $400 - $900 near campus, many students can also afford owning a car. 

			<h6 id="news">Q: Is there anything special I should do when I apply? </h6>
			A: Yes! If you want to work with me, be sure to list my name in your application. If in doubt, email me after you've completed your application, I can check to ensure you show up in the system. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Could I do summer internships during phd? </h6>
			A: I encourage phd students to do internships. Internship is a good opportunity to gain research experience.  
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: What computing servers do your group use? </h6>
			A: My students usually use the clusters (over 100 nodes with NVIDIA Tesla P100 and Tesla V100 GPUs) at Ohio Supercomputer Center for running deep learning models. We also have two in-house GPU servers. 

			
			<h6 id="news">Q: What is life like in Columbus Ohio? <figure><img src="files/columbus.jpg"

			A: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio">Columbus</a> is the capital city of Ohio and 14th-largest city in the United States. It has an art scene with <a href="http://www.columbusunderground.com/events/">concerts, gallery events</a>, and constantly changing art exhibitions at <a href="https://pizzuticollection.org/">Pizzuti Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.wexarts.org/">Wexner Center of Arts</a> and Columbus Museum of Art. The zoo and botanical garden are among the best rated in the united states. Lots of <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Columbus">good restaurants</a> of different cuisines, microbreweries, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/mouton-columbus">cocktail bars</a>, boutique <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=latte&find_loc=Columbus,+OH">coffee shops</a> and speciality grocery stores (Japanese, Chinese, etc). The Olentangy river trail that goes through OSU campus is good for running and biking to office. OSU is a <a href="https://recsports.osu.edu/facilities">super sporty school</a>; a large state-of-the-art gym and the football stadium are right next to CS building. Short direct flights to Chicago, New York, Washington DC, Denver (<a href="http://coloradoski.com/resorts">world-class skiing</a> & hiking), Toronto and Philadelphia for weekend getaways or commutes; driving distance to Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Lake Erie and other places.

			<h4 id="news">For undergraduate, masters, phd students already at OSU</h4>
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Can you advise me on research or be my advisor?</h6>
			A: Send me an email with your resume. My main interest is in natural language processing. You may learn more about my research on my <a href="./index.html">homepage</a> and through my <a href="./index.html#publications">publications</a>. I also recommend reading Jason Eisner's <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-work-with-a-professor.html"> advice</a> to students who want to work with a professor. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Would you work with undergraduate and masters students?</h6>
			A: Yes! In fact, several undergraduate and masters students not only worked but have published research papers with me. Four of them got PhD offers from top universities (UIUC, UWashington, CMU), while others got full-time jobs at Microsoft and Amazon. I primarily recruit undergraduate and masters students from the <a href="./index.html#teach">classes</a> I teach.
